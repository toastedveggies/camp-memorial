    <p>Richard and Polly were Clarissa’s maternal grandparents — the beginning of the family’s Quaker tradition. The Boyajian family emigrated from Armenia to Chicago, via Egypt in the early twentieth century. They brought with them a deep sense of community, craftsmanship, and faith. Richard was a high school biology teacher, and then proprietor of a small Hyde Park shop, Boyajian’s Bazaar, where he sold hand crafted goods and all kinds of unique items — from driftwood and handmade goods from around the world.</p>
    <p>Richard and Polly lived in Chicago and came to visit the family in the Pacific Northwest once or twice a year. Richard loved to collect driftwood for the Bazaar and couldn’t walk past a scrap of litter without picking it up. He cut up cereal boxes to make notecards and kept them in his shirt pocket to jot down ideas.</p>
    <p>Polly shared his civic spirit. In her younger years, she marched with Dr. King in Chicago, pushing a stroller with her children. Near the end of her life, when she lived on Vashon Island, her daughters helped her fill out and cast one last ballot — a final act of duty that would have made her proud.</p>
    <p>If they were here today, they might be surprised by the size of the celebration, but they’d smile to see so many people gathered in joy, and they’d join in, as they always did — present, loving, and full of faith.</p>
