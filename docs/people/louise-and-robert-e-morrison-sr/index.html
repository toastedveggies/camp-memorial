    <p>Robert never met his grandfather Robert E. Morrison Sr., who died before he was born. He was a dairy farmer, a World War II veteran, and by all accounts a patient and steady man who cared deeply for his family. He looked after not only his wife and children but also his sister and parents. He was tall and handsome — traits his family likes to think run in the blood. On the wedding day, Robert will carry his grandfather’s pocket watch, which he inherited when his grandmother passed away.</p>
    <p>Louise — Robert’s grandmother and lifelong neighbor growing up — was known to him and his siblings as Mawmaw. He could walk through the woods to her house in about fifteen minutes, and they often spent Saturdays there. She taught them to weave baskets, snap green beans, and shell lima beans. She always had pecans on the coffee table, cookies in the jar, and college basketball on the TV. Louise valued education and civic duty, working the polls for many years and encouraging her children to go to college.</p>
    <p>If she were here today, she’d tell Robert to take good care of Clarissa, to be kind and responsible, and probably to move back to North Carolina — though she’d understand why he hasn’t. Both she and her husband would be proud to see family gathered, their values still alive in their children and grandchildren.</p>
