    <p>Laura was one of Clarissa’s childhood Quaker friends — part of the tight-knit group they called “R CLAMs R CALM” (Rachel, Clarissa, Laura, Abey, Maya, and sometimes Sierra). Their parents all went to college together, and the kids grew up spending time at Quaker group activities.</p>
    <p>Laura was vibrant and creative, always expressing herself — her bright curly red hair, sometimes dyed wild colors or shaved into patterns. Each spring, the R CLAMs, all born between April 19th and June 13th (Laura’s birthday), would celebrate their birthdays together at Rachel’s family cabin on the Washington coast. This included cheesecake, bonfires on the beach, running into the ocean at night to pee at night into the phosphorescent waves, laughter, and friendship.</p>
    <p>Laura was loyal, open-hearted, and always there when someone needed her. If she were here today, she’d give Clarissa a big hug — and tell Robert not to hurt her.</p>
