    <p>Papaw Harvey married Robert’s grandmother Kaye in 1983, and he was really the only grandfather Robert knew. To him, Papaw represented fun and warmth — always ready with a joke, a story, or a photo. He was the life of the party, the Energizer Bunny in a half-off suit from Sears, dancing with Grandma and taking pictures of everyone. He had great hair and always smelled good — a scent Robert still notices when he wears one of the shirts passed down to him after Papaw died.</p>
    <p>Once, they went fishing together in Alaska, and Robert caught the biggest fish of his life (so far). Just as he was feeling proud, the first mate grabbed it, tossed it back overboard, and said it was too small. Papaw and Robert just looked at each other and laughed.</p>
    <p>If Papaw were here today, he’d be ready to dance, camera in hand, probably needing to be reminded that they already hired a photographer. He’d make sure Grandma was warm and cared for, and he’d remind everyone to have fun.</p>
