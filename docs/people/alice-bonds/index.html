    <p>Alice “Nana” Bonds was Robert’s great-grandmother — his grandmother Kaye’s mother. She lived in a small house by the railroad tracks in Kannapolis and worked for Cannon Mills most of her life. She crocheted toboggans, harvested plums from her backyard tree to make jam, and baked a pound cake that nobody could match.</p>
    <p>When Robert was little, he would sit on Nana’s living-room floor watching TV — the new set perched on top of the old one — and play with Lincoln Logs and Tinker Toys that had belonged to Nana’s children. Nana didn’t exactly approve of smashing pennies on the railroad tracks, but she tolerated it with careful supervision from an aunt or uncle, and he loved finding the warm, flattened coins afterward.</p>
    <p>Nana was a practicing Jehovah’s Witness, but Robert remembers visiting her nursing home near the end of her life to sing Christmas carols with people from church. She asked the group to sing a new carol — she said she’d heard the old ones too many times — and smiled the whole way through.</p>
    <p>When Robert thinks of her now, he remembers quiet strength, hard work, and the beauty Nana made with her hands. If she were here today, she’d sit somewhere watching everyone laugh and dance, smiling softly — her way of saying she loves them.</p>
