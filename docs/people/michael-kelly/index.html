    <p>Michael was Clarissa’s step-grandfather, but he was really the only paternal grandfather she knew. Married to her Grandma Martha, he was a steady, affectionate presence — the kind of grandpa who always showed up.</p>
    <p>When Clarissa was little, he would toss her in the pool, flipping her mid-air. He and Martha would also take Clarissa to the amusement park. Grandpa Mike would stay on the ground while they rode roller coasters, waving from below. They often went to the movies together — and he would fall asleep almost every time. Seabiscuit was the only movie the three ever watched together in a theater where Grandpa stayed awake from start to finish. At home, the three of them played Yahtzee, Tri-Ominos, and Rummikub for hours — with Grandpa keeping excellent score.</p>
    <p>If he were here today, he’d give Clarissa a big hug, tell her he loved her, and say how proud he was.</p>
