    <p>Uncle Ed was Robert’s father’s oldest brother, and they share the same first and last name. When Robert was in the hospital after his car accident in 2006, Uncle Ed wrote messages to him almost every day, always signing them “Keep on keepin’ on.” He was a logger, a big man with an even bigger heart, and he knew how to have fun.</p>
    <p>Whenever Robert feels shy or hesitant now, he thinks of Uncle Ed — how he wasn’t afraid to be a little silly or different. Uncle Ed taught him that if you just keep going, things usually work out because you didn’t quit.</p>
    <p>If Uncle Ed were here today, he wouldn’t be teasing Robert — he’d be making friends with anyone he hadn’t met yet, laughing and bringing people together the way he always did, just like he always knew you.</p>
